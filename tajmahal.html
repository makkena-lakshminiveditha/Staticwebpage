                <p class="description">
                    The Taj Mahal, located on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra,
                    India, is one of the most iconic monuments in the world. Recognized as
                    a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World,
                    it is celebrated for its extraordinary beauty and deep emotional significance.
                    For centuries, the Taj Mahal has stood not just as an architectural masterpiece,
                    but also as a symbol of love, devotion, and artistic excellence.
                    Commissioned in 1632 by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, the Taj Mahal was
                    built in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away during
                    childbirth. Construction continued for over two decades, employing more than
                    20,000 artisans, architects, and laborers from across the Mughal Empire.
                    Its design was influenced by Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles, resulting
                    in one of the most harmonious and perfectly proportioned structures ever built.
                    The Taj Mahal is crafted from pristine white marble and adorned with intricate 
                    floral designs, precious stone inlays, and symmetrical patterns. Its central dome, 
                    flanked by four minarets, reflects a perfect balance of Persian, Islamic, and Indian 
                    architectural styles. The surrounding gardens, fountains, and reflecting pools enhance 
                    its serene beauty.The monument is crafted from the finest white marble sourced from Makrana,
                    Rajasthan, and decorated with precious and semi-precious stones including jade, crystal, 
                    lapis lazuli, amethyst, and turquoise. The central dome rises to a height of 73 meters, 
                    flanked by four slender minarets that tilt slightly outward to protect the main structure 
                    in case of collapse. The intricate pietra dura inlay work, calligraphy, 
                    and symmetrical Mughal gardens create an atmosphere of grandeur and serenity.
                    Visitors to the Taj Mahal are captivated not only by its grand design but also by the
                    peaceful ambiance of its surroundings. Sunrise and sunset views are especially breathtaking,
                    as the marble changes color with the light. Whether admired from a distance or explored up 
                    close, the Taj Mahal leaves every visitor with an unforgettable experience.
