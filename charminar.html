                <p class="description">
                    The Charminar, located in the heart of Hyderabad, Telangana, is one of India’s
                    most recognized historical landmarks. Built over four centuries ago, it is the 
                    symbol of Hyderabad and an outstanding example of Indo-Islamic architecture. 
                    Surrounded by bustling markets and vibrant streets, the Charminar is not just a 
                    monument, but a living part of the city’s culture and heritage.
                    The Charminar was constructed in 1591 by Sultan Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, 
                    the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. Historical accounts suggest it 
                    was built to commemorate the founding of Hyderabad or as a gesture of gratitude 
                    for the end of a deadly plague in the region. The monument’s name, "Charminar," 
                    translates to “Four Minarets” in Urdu, referring to its four grand towers.
                    it is the center of Hyderabad’s old city and a hub of culture, tradition, and bustling
                    commerce. With its commanding presence and intricate design, the Charminar has been a
                    witness to over 400 years of the city’s history.
                    Visiting the Charminar offers more than just a glimpse into history—it’s an 
                    immersive cultural experience. The surrounding Laad Bazaar is famous for its 
                    colorful bangles, pearls, and traditional Hyderabadi delicacies. The lively 
                    atmosphere, combined with the monument’s historic charm, makes it a must-visit 
                    spot for tourists. Whether admired in the soft morning light or under the night’s 
                    golden glow, the Charminar continues to inspire awe and wonder.
                    Standing 56 meters high, the Charminar is made of granite and lime mortar, 
                    with stucco decorations adding to its charm. Each of its four minarets is 
                    crowned with a bulbous dome and intricate carvings, connected by massive arches
                    that face north, south, east, and west. The structure also houses a small mosque 
                    on its upper floor, which is still used for prayers today. At night, the monument 
                    is illuminated, highlighting its elegance and intricate details.Its strategic location 
                    in the middle of four main roads made it a focal point for trade, gatherings, and royal
                    processions. Over the centuries, it has remained central to Hyderabad’s social and cultural life.
