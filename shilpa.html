                    Shilparamam, located in the bustling area of Madhapur in Hyderabad, is a 
                    vibrant arts and crafts village that showcases India’s rich cultural heritage.
                    Established in 1992, this cultural hub was created to promote and preserve traditional 
                    Indian handicrafts and folk art. Spread over 65 acres, Shilparamam offers visitors a unique 
                    experience of rural charm right in the middle of the city, with lush greenery, rustic huts, 
                    and open-air markets.
                    The village is home to artisans from across the country, who display and sell their handmade crafts,
                    textiles, pottery, jewelry, and traditional art pieces. Visitors can watch craftsmen at work, giving them 
                    an insight into the skill and dedication involved in making each product. Seasonal fairs and exhibitions, 
                    such as the annual Shilparamam Arts and Crafts Festival, attract both locals and tourists, making it a lively 
                    and colorful destination year-round.
                    Shilparamam is not just about shopping—it is a celebration of culture. The venue regularly hosts folk dances, 
                    music performances, puppet shows, and theatrical plays, bringing alive the vibrant traditions of India. 
                    The open-air amphitheater and cultural performances add to the charm, making it a perfect spot for families, 
                    art enthusiasts, and culture lovers. The serene artificial lake and rock garden inside the village provide a 
                    peaceful escape from the city’s rush.

                    leaves visitors with lasting memories. Whether you come to shop for authentic handicrafts, enjoy a cultural 
                    performance, or simply take a leisurely stroll through the beautifully landscaped pathways, Shilparamam is a 
                    must-visit attraction that reflects the heart and soul of India’s artistic traditions.
